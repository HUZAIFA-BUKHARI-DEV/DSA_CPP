Install a C++ compiler.
==========================================>
[Seriously. You can’t compile code with hopes and prayers.]

Options:

a) Turbo C++ – ancient, dusty, and still haunting some schools.
b) Dev C++ – stuck in the early 2000s, but it gets the job done.
c) The Smart Choice: VS Code + GCC (MinGW)

Reminder: VS Code is not a compiler, it's just a fancy text editor. You still need g++ or another compiler to actually run your code.

!!!! Wait Wait !!!! What????? :

I don’t know what a compiler is :(

Oh seriouslyyyyy... OK, I’m sooo sorry — I don’t have time to explain. So head toward YouTube or one of those creepy 1000-page books etx Oh sorry — etg Oh damn... etc... wait... "!error etc not found"

what ;(

“etc” is correct.

Then what’s the error then?

Let’s GPT this.
{

user: "Hey GPT! What’s the error in etc, I’ve been braining for 2 hours dude."
GPT: Dear programmer... wait, are you even a programmer?
     Well, I can’t roast my user so let me behave:
     >> "You’re missing a dot (.) at the end of 'etc' like this: etc."
user: "Oh mannnnnnnnn..."

}

hahaha .... Harsh truth about programming, but hey — you’ll get used to it.

Too lazy to read docs?
Search “How to install C++ compiler” on YouTube. Tons of tutorials out there — just avoid the ones where the guy’s whispering into a potato mic.

Nope. Not doing that here.

If you're looking for paragraphs about how
"C++ is a powerful object-oriented language invented by Bjarne something-something..."
Go read a textbook.

This repo is for learning C++ by writing C++ — not reading how it could potentially solve world hunger.

Write some code. Break some code. Fix it.
That’s how you’ll figure out its power.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   TL;DR   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- Install a compiler
- Open up VS Code or whatever IDE you like
- Write code
- Forget a semicolon
- Spend an hour debugging
- Learn the hard way
- Repeat
