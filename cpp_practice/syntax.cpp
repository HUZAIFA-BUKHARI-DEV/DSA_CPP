// This is a simple C++ program to demonstrate basic syntax.


// #include <bits/stdc++.h> // Not recommended for C++17, use specific headers instead like <iostream>, <vector>, etc.
#include <iostream> // Include the iostream header for input/output operations
using namespace std; // Use the standard namespace to avoid prefixing std:: before standard functions and objects
int main() { // Main function where the program execution starts

    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // this prints "Hello, World!" to the console

    return 0; // Return 0 indicates that the program ended successfully
}// End of the main function



// wait ! what the heck are these // two lines everywhere?  Aah ! got it  ..... these // two lines are called Comments. Are used just to make the code understandable, like normal notes made to understand complex physics , maths , english etc topics.
